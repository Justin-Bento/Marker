A journal is simply a blank notebook waiting to be filled. Journaling is the intentional act of capturing life’s moments, thoughts, and reflections within those pages. By dedicating time each day to pour your thoughts onto paper, you can use visual expressions as a tool for personal growth and self-discovery.
