At its core, a journal is simply a blank notebook waiting to be filled. Journaling, then, is the intentional act of capturing life's moments, thoughts, and reflections within those pages. Those who engage in journaling dedicate time each day to pour their thoughts onto paper, using visual expressions as a tool for personal growth and self-discovery.

## Getting Started with Jouranling. 

Journaling is an easy and inexpensive self-help tool, requiring only an intention to explore life honestly.

1. Define your primary purpose for journaling. What do you hope to gain from journaling?
2. Decide whether you want to journal by hand or digitally on a computer.
3. Gathering your journaling supplies:
   a. You'll need a notebook.
   b. The second item you'll need is a pen.
   c. Dedicate time to journaling.

Determine what types of journaling you want to do, and if appropriate, begin with some writing prompts, or you can simply start writing whatever comes to mind.
