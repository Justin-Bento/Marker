A pocket notebook is a versatile tool designed to help you capture all your thoughts, enabling you to reflect on them later. Journaling often involves revisiting past or current trauma, difficult memories, and complex emotions, aiming to deepen your connection with your experiences. It's important to acknowledge that some aspects of journaling may be uncomfortable.

Our goal is to highlight potential challenges and support you in building a system that identifies habits and traits.

Here are the steps to get started:

**Obtain a pocket notebook:** If a local stationery store is accessible, purchase a small, inexpensive pocket notebook and a pen. However, if this isn't feasible, consider using any available notebook or even digital journaling apps as alternatives.

**Set up your journaling space:** Find a quiet and comfortable space where you can focus on your journaling practice without distractions. This could be a cozy corner of your home or a peaceful outdoor spot.

**Establish a journaling routine:** Decide on a consistent time each day to dedicate to journaling. Whether it's first thing in the morning, during your lunch break, or before bed, having a regular journaling schedule can help build momentum and make it a habit.

**Choose journaling prompts:** Instead of solely focusing on building a system, consider incorporating journaling prompts to guide your reflections. These prompts can help you explore different aspects of your life, emotions, and experiences, providing valuable insights and self-awareness.

**Reflect and adjust:** Regularly reflect on your journaling practice to see what's working well and what could be improved. Be open to adjusting your approach as needed to better meet your needs and goals.

So for now ignore your goals of "journaling every day" and focused only on your system, that would get you to still succeed in.

Remember, journaling is a personal practice, and there's no right or wrong way to do it. Don't feel pressured to create the perfect system or write perfect entries. Embrace imperfection and simply show up to the page as you are. We're here to ease this barrier and help make journaling a viable part of your daily lifestyle. In the next article, we'll discuss several types of journals and break down each system.
