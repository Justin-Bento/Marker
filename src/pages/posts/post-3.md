Journaling is deeply personal, and while it's crucial to stay aware of our surroundings, I'm not suggesting you rearrange your entire space. My aim is to stress the significance of a tidy environment when putting your thoughts on paper. Think of it as starting with a clean slate.

As I jot down this article with pen and paper, I've made sure to tidy up my surroundings, given the limited space on my desk. To my left, I have a cup of green tea, and I've turned off my computer and monitor. If you're in a similar situation, here are some steps you can follow to declutter and enhance your journaling experience.

## Cleaning Steps That Have Worked for Me

1. Set a timer to keep yourself on track.

2. Designate a "no parking" zone for items that don't belong on your workspace.

3. Put things away when you're finished using them.

4. Organize your workspace based on different activities.

5. Establish a routine to signal transitions between activities.

6. Perform a nightly cleanup to start fresh the next day.

7. Remember to enjoy the process and not take it too seriously.
