- **Unstructured:** As the name suggests, this type of journaling is completely free-form, consisting of simply writing whatever is on your mind at that time (also known as free writing). This method helps clear the mind, remove excess clutter, and alleviate stress.


- **Reflective:** A structured method focused on finding meaning by examining life events and asking deep questions. When you use reflective journaling, you examine emotional responses, thoughts, belief systems, and behaviors to increase self-awareness and potentially take action for improvement.

- **Mindfulness:** The goal of this meditative process is to bring your awareness into the present moment through the observation of thoughts, feelings, and surroundings. Benefits of mindfulness journaling include feelings of peace, reduced stress, and increased well-being.

- **Bullet:** Bullet Journaling is a structured system developed in 2013 by Ryder Carroll to organize thinking and remain focused on important priorities. Bullet Journaling helps increase productivity, document and track life events, and build desired habits, among other benefits.

- **Creative:** While most journaling methods focus on writing, creative journaling, which can be incorporated into any of the other journaling methods, allows for self-expression using various visual methods. Along with writing, creative journaling may include drawing, doodling, painting, photo collages, and other forms of multimedia. Digital versions may also include audio and video.

- **Gratitude:** Focuses specifically on identifying things and people in your life to be thankful for, with the purpose of building an overall sense of gratitude. Benefits of gratitude journaling include decreased stress levels, increased self-awareness, a renewed perspective on challenges, improved emotional health, and enhanced happiness.

- **Seizure Diary:** Focuses on tracking seizures, recording medication intake, documenting each seizure occurrence, and noting events before and after each seizure. A seizure diary helps individuals monitor and manage their seizures effectively.

In conclusion, these are just a few types of journals to help you get started. The key is to experiment and find what works best for you!
