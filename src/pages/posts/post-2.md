To successfully establish a robust journaling practice, take the time to read the following actions to help you get started.

1.	**Know why you're journaling**: Think about who, what, when, where, and why you want to journal. Having a clear reason is important. Over time, answering these questions will help you understand why journaling is important to you.

2.	**Get a notebook and pen**: Head over to your local stationary store find your smallest notebook and grab a pen. We recommend grabbing a pocket notebook and a pen that you like to write with. 

3.	**Start small**: Journaling might seem hard at first, so start with just two minutes a day. Keep it simple to get started. 

4.	**Embrace imperfection**:  Don't worry if you're not sure what to write or if things aren't perfect. Journaling is a learning process, and it's okay to mess up!

5.	**Find a quiet place**: Pick a comfortable spot without distractions to write in your journal. Consider starting your journaling routine before bed to relax and plan for the next day. 

6.	**Journal with extracurricular actives**: Include motivational quotes, track your fitness, or write about your day. Your journal can be about anything you want.  

7.	**Start Writing**: Find a cozy spot, grab your pen, and start writing down your thoughts. Don't worry about spelling or grammarâ€”just let your ideas flow.

With these simple steps, you're all set to begin your journaling journey. Remember, it's okay to start small and make it your own. Happy journaling!
