# Marker

Marker is a platform designed to help people with epilepsy discover the benefits of keeping a combined seizure diary and journal. As you explore these pages, you'll find a personal way to track seizures, identify triggers, and improve your treatment plans. Over time, this will help you better understand your triggers, your relationship with epilepsy, and give you some control in this chaotic world.

**Note:** *I am not a doctor. This entire webpage is dedicated to sharing my personal experience with epilepsy to help others avoid similar mistakes I've ignored. Always consult a medical professional for advice and treatment.*
